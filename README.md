# doesn't matter ball

doesn't matter ball is a Metaball shader entirely written in [GLSL](https://www.khronos.org/opengl/wiki/Core_Language_(GLSL)).\
Move the balls around and see how they interact with each other.
(Your cursor is also a ball)\
Use the sliders to adjust the threshold and intensity.\
But be careful, they are interdependent!
